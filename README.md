This is a fully functional table reservation application for restaurants, developed using Node.js, React Native, and Expo. The system supports three user roles: User, Admin, and Subadmin, each with distinct permissions and responsibilities.

    User:  Users can register and log in to the system. Once authenticated, they can submit a reservation request by selecting a restaurant, date, time, and party size. Users also have the ability to update their personal information and modify their existing reservations.
    
    Admin: Admins have full access to the system. They can view, edit, and delete both user accounts and reservation applications.
    
    Subadmin: Subadmins are responsible for managing reservation requests. They can view incoming requests from users and choose to either confirm or decline them.

Note: In order for everything to work properly the ip must be changed to the ip of the device.
